House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project
This project explores the task of predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. It provides a comprehensive solution for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, focusing on a user-friendly and informative experience.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing:
Loads data from CSV files.
Handles missing values using appropriate strategies (e.g., imputation, removal).
Performs feature engineering techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical features).
Splits data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Optionally scales numerical features using techniques like StandardScaler.
Machine Learning Models:
Implements and trains various regression models, including:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Allows for easy experimentation with different models through a modular design.
Model Evaluation:
Calculates common performance metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Provides visualizations of predicted vs. actual values to assess model performance.
Visualization:
Generates informative plots and charts to explore data distribution, feature relationships, and model performance.
Helps in understanding the impact of features on house prices.
Benefits:

Easy to Use: The project is well-structured and documented, enabling quick setup and execution.
Modular Design: Experiment with different models and preprocessing techniques with minimal code changes.
Educational Value: Gain practical experience with machine learning for real-world regression tasks.
Clear Insights: Visualization tools aid in understanding the factors influencing house prices.
Potential Applications:

Real estate market analysis
Automated property valuation
Predictive modeling for investment decisions
